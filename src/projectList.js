    text1: "Sweater Weather is a Turing Module 3 project that provides the developer with a series of wireframes and instructions to produce endpoints that the project front-end developers (ficticious) could use. Using request such as 'GET /api/v1/forecast?location=denver,co' the app can retrieve the weather for a city, retrieve a background image for that city, register and user, log an existing user and plan a road trip (duration of the trip and weather at arrival)",
    text2: "The projects asks for T.D.D. (test driven development) to develop the project functionality. Gems such as simplecov, webmock, and vcr, among others help us drive this process. The testing requirements expect 'sad path' path testing along with functionality. This means to test for when the user doesn't do what is expected. For example, entering the wrong password or omitting the confirmation password.",

    text1: "The scenario for this exercise was that one is working for a company developing an E-Commerce Application. The team is working in a service-oriented architecture, meaning the front and back ends of this application are separate and communicate via APIs. The job is to expose the data that powers the site through an API that the front end will consume.",
    text2: "The 'Rails Engine/ Rails Drive' project is an exercise on exposing APIs. The exercise requires using TDD to drive the process and we were provided an spec harness test in 'Rails Drive'. The most challenging part was figuring out how to complete some of these processes without the proper know-how (no lessons provided). This made things very challenging but allowed me to expose areas that need strengthening.",

The 'caretaker' will then receive a notification that everything is fine.",

Each table follows the same pattern of queries and mutations.",
